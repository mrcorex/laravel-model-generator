# Model generator
Auto-generate models for a Laravel 5 project.

**Note: it is recommended to abandon this package and use corex/lmodel instead. It is more up-to-date and uses doctrine/dbal instead of native sql + other advantages. There are a few changes in configuration but easy to convert config to corex/lmodel.** 

**You can continue to use this package. I will do my best to support future versions.**

**Only MySQL will be supported.** 

Connects to your existing database and auto-generates models based on existing schema.
 - Support for multiple dababases.
 - Support for magic properties.
 - Support for custom methods.
 - Support for guarded fields.
 - Support for "extends".
 - Support for extra column-attributes after magic properties.
 - Support for building constants in model.
 - Support for multiple "uses".
 - Support for custom "indent".

# Installation
Run ```"composer require mrcorex/laravel-model-generator"```.

Add a configuration-file called corex and add following code to it. Modify it to suit your needs.
```php
return [
    'laravel-model-generator' => [
        'path' => base_path('app/Models'),
        'namespace' => 'App\Models',
        'databaseSubDirectory' => true,
        'extends' => '',
        'indent' => "\t",
        'uses' => [],
        'const' => [
            '{connection}' => [
                '{table}' => [
                    'id' => '{id}',
                    'name' => '{name}',
                    'prefix' => '{prefix}',
                    'suffix' => '{suffix}',
                    'replace' => [
                        'XXXX' => 'YYYY',
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Settings:

 - **indent** - (optional) String to use as indent i.e. "\t". Default 4 spaces.
 - **uses** - (optional) List of use's. Warning: it does not clean up old uses, if you change "extends" after model initially was created.

 - **{connection}** - (optional) Name of connection.
 - **{table}** - (optional) Name of table.
 - **{id}** - (required) Name of field to get id from used in constant as value.

To register it and make sure you have this option available for development only, add following code to AppServiceProviders@register.
```php
public function register()
{
    if ($this->app->environment() == 'local') {
        $this->app->register('CoRex\Generator\ModelGeneratorProvider');
    }
}
```
